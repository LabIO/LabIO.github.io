   <h1>INSTALLATIONS</h1>
  <p>
EXPAND 2019
During the Expand artistic residency at the headquarters of the association Espaço do Tempo, Montemor, an interactive installation based on SonarX real-time image sonification software, designed by me with colleague Francisco Medeiros, was designed and displayed.

 <p><a href="https://www.largoresidencias.com/projectos/sou-lxpoeta">NEXTSTOP/LXPOETA</a> 2019
As part of the Largo Residências cutural cooperative project, a video installation was created in the northern atrium of the Anjos station. An ultrasonic distance sensor detects the passage of each person and shoots a 5sec video. In the middle of the lobby, an infrared presence sensor activates videos of larger contents, which to be seen until the end requires the person to stir from time to time (as with bathroom light). 
   The system runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B with an Arduino Uno and automatically restarts when the power is turned on without requiring any instruction from those responsible for the festival.https://www.largoresidencias.com/projectos/sou-lxpoeta

<p><a href="https://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/reframebooks/archive2016/live-interfaces/">SYNESTHEATRE</a> 2016
As a presentation of the device developed by the Department of Synesthesia, University of Sussex, an installation was created that allowed users to try it out and verify its usefulness in identifying colored objects in space.
</p>    
<p>CATRAIA TOTEM 2019
Project presented in the first edition of the Catraia Festival, Praia da Tocha, Aveiro. A structure of recycled beach cleaning materials supports a system of 6 distance sensors connected by Arduino that control a lighting system of a 5m strip of LEDs.<a href="https://youtu.be/FTXHnIfcT48>video</a>
</p>
<p>ONYRICUM 2015
At the “Festival della Creativitá” in Rimini, Italy, 2015 an installation was created with two Onyricum systems. This system places the users' images in virtual scenarios with a delay corresponding to the time of the journey between the image capture location and the display location.

Este trabalho é um projeto em contínuo desenvolvimento como sistema de suporte multimédia para eventos de Poetry Slam. Consiste num display generado pelo Raspberry Pi com Pure Data e controlado via browser, com várias funções entre as quais de captar o barulho do público e converte-lo numa nota de 0 a 10.
