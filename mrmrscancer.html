    <h1>Mr Mrs Cancer</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This slams is my answer to my mothers my uncle etc passing away. So much to say, I guess it is written, in some way.<br>

    We live in a society where money leads the way and not in a fair way. <br>
    Politics, medicine, science, education are under pressure of the ruling financial powers.<br>
    Cancers, autoimmune diseases are the first cause of death in the western countries.<br>
    We don't know exactly what causes them. We don't also much about the 2020 supposed pandemic<br>
    Why don't we try to live with less stress, eat better, sleep good, have sex and fun as much as we can?<br>
    That might be the cure, not avaccine whose source is obscure.
